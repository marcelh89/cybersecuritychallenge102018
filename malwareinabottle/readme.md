use linux too find to find out "file" format
``` file "Malware in a Bottle.bin ```

--> prints out Malware in a Bottle.bin: python 2.7 byte-compiled
so we have python bytecode

use python module uncompyle6 to uncompile bytecode 
``` pip install uncompyle6 ```
``` cp "Malware in a Bottle.bin" "Malware in a Bottle.pyc" ```
``` uncompyle6 "Malware in a Bottle.pyc" ```


decompiled code --> decompiled.py


adjust code to be runnable in python3 (prints)

adjust query_cc method to log out self.cc.decrypt_hostname()

run code and type 5 and see solution in log
